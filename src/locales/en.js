  aboutDescription: `I am a passionate enthusiast of IT and technology in general. 
    My professional journey is as diverse as my eclectic taste in music, which ranges 
    from ABBA's pop to ZZ Top's rock. In my spare time, you can find me immersed in a good book, 
    be it technical, historic, filosofic, dramatic, biblical, or fantasy fiction, reflecting my love 
    for reading and continuous learning.
    
    As a cinephile, I appreciate the art of visual storytelling as much as the thrill of a 
    Formula 1 race. Above all, I am a nature lover, finding peace and inspiration whether at 
    the beach, by the sea, or amidst the greenery of the woods.`,

  highlightsDescription: `A professional with over four decades of experience in technology and administration sectors, my career
is marked by significant projects and complex systems. I started in IT, developing solutions such as
annual balance sheets in Lotus 1-2-3, budget control systems in dBase III / Clipper'87 and project
management, implementation and coordination with CA-SuperProject.

My expertise encompasses the creation of a complete telemarketing system in CA-QbyX, implementation
and programming of electronic time register / clocks using Visual Basic, C, and SQL, as well as programming,
adaptation, and implementation of customer service systems (CRM) using BMC AR-System and SQL databases.
After a period in administration, where, among others, I optimized and digitalized management processes, I am
returning to the IT field with a new purpose: to apply my accumulated knowledge now in Data Engineering and AI-driven development, thus contributing to create innovative solutions, reducing time and costs.

My competencies include:
• Design, programming, and implementation of solutions
• Analysis and implementation of large-scale projects
• IT support, Sales and Telemarketing

I am seeking new challenges that allow me to utilize my skills in problem-solving, analytical thinking,
and attention to detail. I am enthusiastic about contributing my vast experience, collaborating with
the growth of a dynamic and future-oriented team.`,
